# RogueTick

Lightweight Vanilla World of Warcraft/Turtle WoW addon for Rogues that provides a visual indicator for the energy regeneration tick.

## Features

- No setup or frames, just a single always visible tick indicator
- Doesn't work for other classes than Rogues for now
- The timer starts when you log in and self-corrects using in-game events to stay synchronized
